        <property name="description" value="Apache Fineract is a secure, multi-tenanted microfinance platform.

        \nThe goal of the Apache Fineract API is to empower developers to build apps on top of the Apache Fineract Platform.
        \nThe reference app (username: mifos, password: password) works on the same demo 'tenant' as the interactive links in this documentation.

        \n\nThe API is organized around REST.

        \nThe API is designed to have:
        - predictable, resource-oriented URLs
        - to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors
        - to use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.
        \nJSON is returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
        \nMuch of the API presentation and design ideas are owed to the excellent Apigee Web API Design eBook/PDF and the very good Stripe API reference. "/>
